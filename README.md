# Predicting-Miles-Per-Gallon-of-Cars

# Problem Statement
Prediction of Miles per Gallon (mpg) on the basis of different features like displacement, horsepower, origin of a car, weight etc. We need to find which factors mostly affect the fuel consumption of a car in order to improve the mpg value. Hence build a model to predict the mpg value of each car.
